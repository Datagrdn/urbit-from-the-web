# Urbit from the Web

## Part 1

### Overview

Here in Part 1, we're going to cover the basics of how to communicate with an Urbit ship's backend from a trivial vanilla frontend using our `urb.js` HTTP API and `:talk` as a simple message bus. We'll be able to send direct messages to our ship and other ships, create new personal "stations" where we can aggregate messages, and load a station's messages on the page.

If you haven't already, follow the instructions in our documentation to [install Urbit](https://urbit.org/docs/using/install) and [setup your first ship](https://urbit.org/docs/using/setup). You'll be able to boot a free _comet_, or disposable Urbit identity, to serve as the ship for this tutorial.

Let's get started!

### Let's start up our ship!

Fire up your ship as per our [basic operation](https://urbit.org/docs/using/admin/) doc.

```
$ urbit mycomet
```

If your ship is running, you'll be in a `:dojo` prompt. Something like this:

```
~
urbit 0.4.4
urbit: home is mycomet
...
http: live (insecure, public) on 8080
http: live ("secure", public) on 8443
http: live (insecure, loopback) on 12321
ames: czar zod.urbit.org: ip .104.197.214.171
~darlen_dolmyn:dojo>
```

where `~darlen_dolmyn` is your comet name, abbreviated.

> For this tutorial series, we'll abbreviate the `~darlen_dolmyn:dojo` prompt to just `>`:

> ```
> >
> ```

For those still new to Urbit, the `:dojo` is just Urbit's version of a command line.

### 1.0 - Let's serve a file to the web.

We'll assume your ship's `%clay` filesystem is mounted to your local machine as per the setup doc linked in the overview above.

An Urbit ship boots with a default Arvo `home` *desk*, or version-controlled directory:

```
$ ls mycomet/home
app  arvo  gen  lib  mar  ren  sec  sur  web  web.md
```

Your home desk's `web` directory is the equivalent of a public_html directory. Your ship looks in this directory to serve content to the world.

More details [here](https//urbit.org/docs/using/web/).

For this tutorial, we've included all the necessary frontend code for you to run in a Git repo for you to clone.

Go ahead and clone the following repo somewhere:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/keatondunsford/urbit-from-the-web.git
```

Then, copy all the files inside to your web directory:

```
$ cp -r urbit-from-the-web mycomet/home/web
```

As we progress, you can simply `git checkout` to the appropriate branch for the section, and everything should just work.

Our first example for this section is in the `1.0` branch, so let's go ahead and `cd` into our web directory and checkout to the `1.0` branch to serve our first example to the web. We'll use the `-f` flag to force the changes between branches:

```
$ cd mycomet/home/web
$ git checkout -f 1.0
```

If this worked, you should see in your `:dojo` that your ship registered that a new file was imported, a `tutorial.html` file:

```
+ /~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/home/2/web/tutorial/html
>
```

This is just an HTML Hello World:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Urbit from the Web</title>
  </head>
  <body>

      <div>
        <h1>Hello, Mars!</h1>
        <button onclick="someJavaScript();">A button test!</button>
      </div>

      <script>
        console.log("We're serving some JavaScript through Urbit to the browser!");

        function someJavaScript () {
          console.log("Now we're calling some other JavaScript.")
        }
      </script>

    </body>
</html>
```

This file is now already being served to the web.

Your Urbit web directory gets served to `localhost` port `8443`. Let's load that up:

```
http://localhost:8443/tutorial.html
```

Sure enough:

!['Hello, Mars!' We're serving some trivial HTML and JavaScript to the browser. through Urbit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13459143/23775012/5fc32fee-04db-11e7-9cad-116cca2528b8.gif)

A quick look at your browser dev tools should show that our trivial HTML and JavaScript work.

> Note that if you had a first Urbit ship running when you started up your current comet, your web directory will be served to `https://localhost:8444`; two other ships running, `https://localhost:8445`, etc.

Every running ship also maps to urbit.org's DNS at `ship.urbit.org`. You can see your full comet ship name with the `our` dojo command.

```
> our
~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn
```

Then, you can see this same page at something like `https://darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn.urbit.org/tutorial.html` in your browser. Things should be working just the same.

### 1.1 - Time to talk to Urbit.

Let's start with a hard-coded way to say hi to our ship.

Checkout to the `1.1` branch for this section:

```
$ git checkout -f 1.1
```

If you look back in your `:dojo`, you should see that your ship recognized a change to your `tutorial.html` file:

```
: /~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/home/3/web/tutorial/html
>
```

The `%clay` version-control number of your home directory should be incremented as a result of the change.

Reload the page, and with your browser dev tools again and your `:dojo` in sight, click the button!

> hi appears on page gif

Let's go over what just happened.

Somehow from clicking that button, you were able to talk to your ship.

We did this using the simple HTTP API in our small `urb.js` library, which is included in all booted ships' web directories by default. We sourced urb.js in our .html file via a `<script src>` tag in our `<head>`.

Here's the code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>An Urbit social app tutorial</title>

    <script src="/~/at/=home=/web/lib/js/urb.js"></script>

  </head>
  <body>

    <br />

    <div>
      <button onclick="sayHi();"><h1>Say hi to your ship!</h1></button>
    </div>

    <br />

    <div id="loadHi">
    </div>

    <script>
      function sayHi () {
        window.urb.send('hi. :)', {
          appl: 'hood',
          mark: 'helm-hi'
        }, function (err, res) {
          if (err || !res.data) {
            console.log(path, 'err!');
            console.log(err);
            return;
          }
          console.log('We just said hi to our ship!');
          console.log(res.data);
        });

        var hi = '';
        hi += '<div class="hi">';
        hi += '<h2><code>< ~' + window.urb.ship + ': hi. :)</code></h2>'
        hi += '</div>';
        return document.getElementById('loadHi').innerHTML = hi;

      };

    </script>

  </body>
</html>
```

`/=home=/` in that `<script src>` tag just means, "your most current home directory", since everything is version-controlled through %clay.

By appending the `/~/at/` before the file path in that tag, we told our ship to inject authentication and user data to the top of our urb.js file under the `window.urb` object.

Pretty-printed:

```
var _urb = {
  "oryx": "bardys-ridmes-salser-napreg--watwer-ribmyn-midsul-digber",
  "user": "darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn",
  "sein": "zod",
  "ixor": "morret-taspeg-ritlug-fortug",
  "ship": "darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn",
  "auth": [
    "darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn"
  ]
};
```

- An `oryx` is just a [CSRF token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) for authentication. 
- `ixor` is a hash of this CSRF token, also for authentication. 
- `user`, `ship` and `auth` are all additionally there for authentication; if one of the three doesn't match, your ship will know something isn't right. 
- And lastly, `sein` is the parent of the current ship; all comets have galaxy parents, and in this case, our parent is `~zod`. This is needed so your ship knows where to get its packets, or _cards_ from.

If you look in the JavaScript of your HTML body's `<script>`, we wrote a `'hi'` `<div>` to display the value of `window.urb.ship`, which, as per the injected object above, in this case is your comet ship name. 

XX  We added some extra text in the div to mimic the 'hi' message you got in your `:dojo`. Then we just set our `onClick` button event to call our `sayHi` function which, upon clicking the button, swapped the empty `loadHi` `<div>` with the above 'hi' div that displays your hi message.

urb.js has several wrapper functions over different [XMLHttpRequests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest) that can send different requests to your ship's web server, `%eyre`. For this simple example, we called the `urb.send` function, which takes as arguments a data value, an object of parameters further specifying the message being sent, and a callback function to execute upon a successful or failed request. The function then takes the data value and message parameters and inputs them as arguments to `JSON.stringify`, the product of which is sent as a JSON payload to your ship's backend. You ship was then able to parse this JSON and send the right contents to the right Hoon program for execution.

Here's the pretty-printed JSON payload `urb.send` delivered:

```
{
  "oryx": "modtuc-diffus-ropdef-novluc--satlev-tomrut-lodres-digweg",
  "xyro": "hi. :)",
  "ship": "darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn",
  "appl": "hood",
  "mark": "helm-hi",
  "wire": "/"
}
```

- We're already familiar with what our `oryx` is: an authenticated CSRF token. 
- Our data value, named `xyro`, was just the string 'hi. :)'. 
- The default `ship` value is the same one in the `window.urb` object described above. 
- The `params` we specified we placed in an object that contained two name-value pairs: 
  1. our `appl`, for 'application', was `hood`, your ship's system daemon; 
  2. and and our `mark`, or message type, was a `helm-hi`, which just told `hood` to run our simple _helm-hi_ Hoon program to take the data value sent and print it to the screen, like a traditional 'Hello, world!'. 
- Lastly, the `wire` value we didn't use this time and thus just defaulted to its fallback default path, `\`. But in other kinds of requests, as we'll see in a later section, adding a special wire path can allow us to do some pretty cool things.

XX  Lastly, upon the successful request, our callback function simply console.logged the request response; our ship sent us an `{ok:true}`, meaning "everything is all good!". And it console.logged a string we hard-coded, telling us we sent a 'hi' to our ship.

Another example will help make more sense of this. Let's try sending ourselves a `:talk` message.

### 1.3 - Let's send some messages using `:talk`

You've probably already used `:talk` the app for chat from the command line, the browser, or both. But really, the `:talk` protocol is a general-purpose piece of infrastructure for messaging and notifications that `:talk`-the-app just happens to use. Meaning, we can actually use the `:talk` protocol as a basic message bus to power any kind of app.

Before we checkout to the next branch, you'll need to officially `Log In` to your ship for full authentication privileges. That way we can send `:talk` messages from our own code smoothly. And while we're at it, we can take a peek at `:talk` the existing web app to better understand the `:talk` protocol it's built on top of.

Head to your `:talk` web UI being served at `https://localhost:8443/~~/talk`. You should be redirected towards a Log In page asking for a password, which you can retrieve from the `+code` `:dojo` command to paste into the Log In box.

If you successfully logged in, your `:talk` web app should load up
automatically.

> screenshot of `:talk` web UI.

Let's delve into what we're looking at.

The `:talk` protocol is organized around _posts_ and _stations_. You can find the details of the `:talk` protocol [here](https://urbit.org/docs/using/messaging).

Let's just try playing around with this in our current `:talk` web UI, and then see if we can replicate similar functionality ourselves with the frontend tools already in your ship.

Since we're on comets, we can send ourselves a direct `:talk` message at our *~ship/porch* station like this:

> GIF close-up of typing, sending and receiving message in web UI and `:dojo`.

Messages sent through the `:talk` protocol on Urbit are encrypted, authenticated, typed, and exactly-once-delivered by default. And since this particular message was sent to your porch -- a publicly write-only, only personally readable station -- and since `:talk` doesn't rely on any server other than your ship's to run, only you in fact are able to access, decrypt and read these particular messages.

Let's see if we if we can code our own simple way to send ourselves a private porch message by modifying our 'sayHi' code from the last section.

We know from the previous section that regular in-HTML `<script>` JavaScript works for trivial functions. For more complex functionality, of course, we'll want to separate our frontend code into its own directory and simply source the compiled ES5 from our HTML `<head>` like we did with urb.js.

We've organized this for you in the `1.3` branch. `checkout` to it:

```
$ git checkout -f 1.3
```

`%clay` should have recognizing the changed tutorial.html file and a newly imported `tutorial` directory and main.js file:

```
: /~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/home/5/web/tutorial/html
+ /~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/home/5/web/tutorial/main/js
>
```

Let's reload our `http://localhost:8443/tutorial.html` page. Go ahead and send
yourself a message!

> GIF 'Send yourself a `:talk` message, ~ship!' + textbox and submit

Let's look at the JSON payload we sent again:

```
{
  "oryx": "falwep-docder-marmev-norpur--sabsem-botlex-hodnup-dirsup",
  "xyro": {
    "publish": [
      {
        "serial": "0v7.985re.6urnn.8g80s.7mn5o.2njuo.0e4mk",
        "audience": {
          "~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/porch": {
            "envelope": {
              "visible": true,
              "sender": null
            },
            "delivery": "pending"
          }
        },
        "statement": {
          "bouquet": [],
          "speech": {
            "lin": {
              "txt": "test from our own code!",
              "say": true
            }
          },
          "date": 1489430871493
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "ship": "darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn",
  "appl": "talk",
  "mark": "talk-command",
  "wire": "/"
}
```

Compared to our 'hi', this `urb.send` payload is actually basically the same:
- We have a different CSRF `oryx`.
- Our `appl` is now `talk`.
- Our `mark` is a `talk-command`.
- Our `ship` and `wire` are the same.
- And then we have this way-different `xyro` data value: a sophisticated
  `:talk` message. 

So, let's look under the hood of our code:

Your `tutorial.html` looks like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Urbit from the Web</title>

    <script src="/~/at/=home=/web/lib/js/urb.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.4/lodash.min.js"></script>
    <script src="/=home=/web/tutorial/main.js"></script>

</head>

<body>

    <div id="loadSend">
    </div>

    <script>
        var station = '';
        switch (window.urb.ship.length) {
            case 3:
                station = 'court';
                break;
            case 6:
                station = 'floor';
                break;
            default:
                station = 'porch';
                break;
        };

        var send = '';
        send += "<div class='send'>";
        send += '<h3>Send a `:talk` post to your ' + station + ', ~' + window.urb.ship + '!</h3>';
        send += '<br />';
        send += '<input type="text" id="audience" value="">'
        send += '<br />';
        send += '<input type="text" id="post" value="">'
        send += '<button onclick="sendPost();">Send!</button>';
        send += '</div>';
        document.getElementById('loadSend').innerHTML = send;
        document.getElementById('audience').value = '~' + window.urb.ship + '/' + station;

        function sendPost() {
            var post = document.getElementById('post').value;
            var audience = document.getElementById('audience').value;
            return send`:talk`Message(post, audience);
        }
    </script>

</body>

</html>
```

and here's your `main.js`:

```
function uuid32() {
    var str = '0v';
    str += Math.ceil(Math.random() * 8) + '.';
    for (i = j = 0; j <= 5; i = ++j) {
        _str = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10000000).toString(32);
        _str = ('00000' + _str).substr(-5, 5);
        str += _str + '.';
    }
    serial = str.slice(0, -1);
    return serial;
}

function send`:talk`Message(txt, audi) {
    var audience = {};
    audience[audi] = {
        envelope: {
            visible: true,
            sender: null
        },
        delivery: 'pending'
    };

    var speech = {
        lin: {
            txt: txt,
            say: true
        }
    };

    var message = {
        ship: window.urb.user,
        thought: {
            serial: uuid32(),
            audience: audience,
            statement: {
                bouquet: [],
                speech: speech,
                date: Date.now()
            }
        }
    };

    var obj = {};
    obj.publish = [message.thought];

    return window.urb.send(
        obj, {
            appl: 'talk',
            mark: 'talk-command'
        },
        function(err, res) {
            console.log('urb.send');
            console.log(obj);
            if (err || !res.data) {
                console.log(path, 'err!');
                console.log(err);
                return;
            }
            console.log(res.data);
            console.log('We just sent our ship a `:talk` message!');
        }
    );
}
```

This code actually isn't super interesting. Our `urb.send` call is basically the same, as we saw from our JSON payload. The only thing different really are the helper functions that collectively we use to format a `:talk` message.

But a `:talk` post is pretty simple; it needs:
- a sender -- your ship in this case;
- an audience-- your porch here; 
- a unique identifier -- `uuid32`; 
- a date -- whenever `now` was at the time the message was sent;
- and the post text itself.

All of the different urb.js requests are [here](http://urbit.org/docs/using/web/#-urb-js) in our Docs. Let's delve into a few more commands in the next sections, though, as they relate to using the `:talk` protocol for our own apps.

### 1.4 & 1.5 - Let's create a new station, send a post to it and load the messages.

Having a single default station is great for just starting out with `:talk`. But it can quickly get out of control after subscribing to a number of stations that are highly active.

It'd be great if we could could separate our feeds a bit by having a second station separate from our porch. Let's see if we can do that.

With the same `1.3` code you have already loaded on the page, try simply changing your audience to a new station, something like, `~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/a-second-station`, and sending yourself another `:talk` post:

> gif of trying to send self message, dojo error pops up.

Assuming you didn't change any code, you won't get a callback error. But this time instead of printing your `:talk` post, you should have gotten a slightly cryptic error message:

```
[%ra-know-not ~.a-second-station]
~darlen_dolmyn:talk[]
```

All your ship is telling you is, "Someone's trying to connect to a station of mine that I don't know anything about", because the stations doesn't exist. We haven't created it yet!

So, how do we create a station?

There's a `:talk` CLI command for creating stations. But it'd be cooler to do this ourselves with another `urb.js` call from the browser.

For UI, instead of having to click a button or something to create the station, we'll automatically send the create-station `urb.js` call when we click the regular 'Send Post' button. We'll execute this new `:talk` command first before sending our message to the new station, in case the station doesn't exist.

Checkout to branch `1.4`:

```
$ git checkout -f 1.4
```

Reload, and try sending to `a-second-station` again!

> gif of no response.

No response at all this time. What's up?

Turns out, it worked! You created the station and the post in fact went through. You're just not seeing the post in the second station because, well, it was sent to the second station! And by design, we wanted this station to be separate from your porch, which is the only feed your CLI `:talk` app is subscribed to.

Okay, so, how do we see our messages? Well, we could subscribe our porch to this
new station from the CLI, but that'd kind of defeat the purpose of creating it
in the first place.

So why don't we load the messages of our second station on our .html page?

Let's `checkout` once more to the next branch where we can load our created
station's messages, after which, we'll delve into the code.

```
$ git checkout -f 1.5
```

Reload the page, and send yourself a new message!

>  gif of messages loading

Alright, let's finally look at the code here. Like last time, it's actually
simpler than we might think.

Here's the HTML:

```

```

and here's the JavaScript:

```

```

Again, the payload we received looks more complicated than it really is. All we got from your ship is a bundle of all the messages from our second station since yesterday (which, in this case, if just the few we sent in the last minute), and we displayed each of them sequentially on the page along with their author and date.

If your Network browser dev tool tab is still up, you should be noticing that you're still getting updates from your ship, like a kind of heartbeat. In fact, this is what `urb.bind` does, the urb.js request type we used for this last section. We're specifying by the path, or `wire`, of our request, that we want all the messages of this station since yesterday. And since our request `PUT` an `urb.bind` request at this path, we essentially told our ship to send us continuous updates about every 30 seconds, like push notifications for iOS.

But wait, 30 seconds seems like kind of a long time for synchronous messaging. If I'm DMing a friend, I totally want to get their messages as soon as they arrive to my ship's backend.

Actually, the 30 second heartbeat is just to reload the feed in case our frontend messed something. Really, your ship does send you new payloads immediately upon arrival, and the page page should refresh automatically.

Let's test this by sending ourself one last message to our second station from the `:dojo`.

> gif of sending message from `:dojo`, messages disappearing except last.

Welp, I guess this is as far as vanilla JavaScript gets us. We'll need a more sophisticated state management system like React/Redux if we want a truly awesome `:talk` app.

But hopefully this tutorial helped you understand some of the basic frontend functionality of Urbit, and how Urbit web apps can work generally.

Thanks for reading!
