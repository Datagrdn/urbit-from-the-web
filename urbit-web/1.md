# An Urbit social app tutorial

## Part 1

### Overview

If you haven't already, follow the instructions in our documentation to
[install Urbit](https://urbit.org/docs/using/install) and
[setup your first ship](https://urbit.org/docs/using/setup). You'll be able to
boot a free *comet*, or disposable Urbit identity, to serve as the ship for
this tutorial.

> If you already have a comet, still boot a new comet for this tutorial as
> there's a bug in the old Arvo `html.hoon` mark where it won't register direct
> .html file changes. But this has been fixed on Arvo's maintenance branch
> and this tutorial will work on a newly booted/synced comet perfectly fine.

For this Part 1, our goal is to quickly get you some frontend vanilla code
running so you can start talking to your ship from the browser. Along the way,
we'll try to explain what's going on.

### Let's start up our ship!

If you followed the setup documentation linked above, you should have a
`mycomet` directory in your `$HOME` or somewhere else you placed it. The
directory itself can have any name you choose, but for this tutorial, we'll
refer to it as your mycomet directory, or *pier*.

Getting your booted comet running, then, should be as easy as:

```
$ urbit mycomet
```

You'll know your ship is running when you're presented with a `:Dojo` prompt.
Something like this:

```
~
urbit 0.4.4
urbit: home is mycomet
...
http: live (insecure, public) on 8080
http: live ("secure", public) on 8443
http: live (insecure, loopback) on 12321
ames: czar zod.urbit.org: ip .104.197.214.171
~darlen_dolmyn:dojo>
```

where `~darlen_dolmyn` is your comet name, abbreviated.

The `:Dojo` is just Urbit's version of a Unix shell and Hoon
[REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).

You can see your full comet name with the `our` Dojo command.

```
~darlen_dolmyn:dojo> our
~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn
```
You'll need this long comet name in a second.

> From now on, we'll abbreviate the `~darlen_dolmyn:dojo` prompt to just `>`:
> ```
> > our
> ~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn
> ```

Awesome. Our ship is running.


### 1.0 - Let's serve a file to the web.

`%clay`, the Urbit filesystem, isn't mounted to Unix by default. We need to
mount our ship in order to add the frontend files that we'll serve to the web.

In Dojo, run:

```
> |mount %
```

This should produce:

```
> |mount %
>=
```

which indicates the command was processed.

`|mount %` will cause a `home` directory to appear inside your pier. Changes to
files in your pier are automatically synced to your ship.

Check in a local shell that this worked:

```
$ ls mycomet
home
```

Now we're all set to add a simple HTML file to our ship and view it from the
browser.

Arvo is the operating system of Urbit. An Urbit ship boots with the default
Arvo structure:

```
$ ls mycomet/home
app  arvo  gen  lib  mar  ren  sec  sur  web  web.md
```

The Arvo `web` directory is the equivalent of a
public_html directory. Your ship looks in this directory to serve content to
the world.

To make things easier for you, and so you can get an idea of the typical
Urbit web-dev workflow, we've included all the necessary code to run for
this tutorial series in a Git repo for you to clone.

Go ahead and clone the following repo to your `$HOME` or wherever you like:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/urbit/urbit-from-the-web
```

As we progress, you can simply `git checkout` to the appropriate branch for
the section, and everything should just work.

Then, now that your ship is mounted, getting the tutorial code into your
ship is as easy as `cp`ing the necessary files from the relevant branch.

Our first example for this section is in the `1.0` branch, so go ahead and
checkout and copy the single .html file into your ship's web directory:

```
$ cd path/to/urbit-from-the-web
$ git checkout 1.0
$ cp tutorial.html ~/mycomet/home/web
```

If this worked, you should see in your Dojo that your ship registered that a new file was imported:

```
+ /~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/home/2/web/tutorial/html
>
```

Cool!

This first file, `tutorial.html`, is just an HTML Hello World:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Urbit from the Web</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <div>
      <h1>Hello, Mars!</h1>
    </div>

  </body>
</html>
```

This file is now already being served to the web.

Every running ships maps to urbit.org's DNS at `ship.urbit.org`. So if you
go grab your full comet name from the Dojo `our` command again, you can see
your this page at something like
`https://darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn.urbit.org/tutorial.html` in your browser.

Sure enough:

> screenshot of 'Hello, Mars!' at long url

No configuring an Apache or Nginx web server. It's all automatic on Urbit.

For development purposes, your Urbit web UI also runs on localhost, which is
naturally a bit faster. So we'll use that for the rest of the tutorial series.

Load up `http://localhost:8443/tutorial.html`:

!['Hello, Mars!'](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13459143/23774338/0fb64660-04d8-11e7-987c-3d25652c9482.png)

Things should be working just the same.

> Note that if you had a first Urbit ship running when you started up your
> current comet, your web directory will be served to
> `https://localhost:8444`; two other ships running, `https://localhost:8445`,
> etc.
>
> Also, as you may have seen in the screenshot, we'll often use incognito tabs
> when working with multiple ships to keep our cookies clean. The choice is
> yours as always.

### 1.1 - Let's run some JavaScript.

Checkout to the `1.1` branch and `cp` in the tutorial.html again for the
changes:

```
$ git checkout 1.1
$ cp tutorial.html ~/mycomet/home/web
```

If you look back in your Dojo, you should see that your ship recognized a
change to the file:

```
: /~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/home/3/web/tutorial/html
>
```

The version-control number of your home directory should be incremented as a
result of the change.


All we did was add a button and this `<script>` tag to your tutorial.html body:

```
  <body>

    <div>
      <h1>Hello, Mars!</h1>
      <button onclick="someJavaScript();">A button test!</button>
    </div>

    <script>
      console.log('We\'re serving some JavaScript through Urbit to the browser!');

      function someJavaScript () {
        console.log('Now we\'re calling some other JavaScript.')
      }
    </script>

  </body>
```

A quick page reload and a look at your browser dev tool Console shows our
vanilla JavaScript works:

![We're serving some JavaScript through Urbit to the browser.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13459143/23775012/5fc32fee-04db-11e7-9cad-116cca2528b8.gif)

Keeping our main development workflow in a Git repo and just `cp`ing our changes
into our ships helps us keep our changes in sync and keep track of what code is
running where, especially when we're switching between various
[fake ships](https://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.1.5..21.31.04..20f3~/), comets
and planets for testing.

### 1.2 - Time to talk to Urbit.

Let's start with a hard-coded way to say hi to our ship.

Checkout to the `1.2` branch and copy in the .html file once more:

```
$ git checkout 1.2
$ cp tutorial.html ~/mycomet/home/web
```

Save, and reload the page.

With your browser Console open and your Dojo in sight, just click the
button!

> hi appears on page gif

Let's go over what just happened.

Somehow from clicking that button, you were able to talk to your ship. We did
this using the simple HTTP API in our small `urb.js` library, which is included
in all booted ships' web directories by default. We sourced urb.js in our .html
file via a `<script src>` tag in our `<head>`.

Here's the code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>An Urbit social app tutorial</title>

    <script src="/~/at/=home=/web/lib/js/urb.js"></script>

  </head>
  <body>

    <br />

    <div>
      <button onclick="sayHi();"><h1>Say hi to your ship!</h1></button>
    </div>

    <br />

    <div id="loadHi">
    </div>

    <script>
      function sayHi () {
        window.urb.send('hi. :)', {
          appl: 'hood',
          mark: 'helm-hi'
        }, function (err, res) {
          if (err || !res.data) {
            console.log(path, 'err!');
            console.log(err);
            return;
          }
          console.log('We just said hi to our ship!');
          console.log(res.data);
        });

        var hi = '';
        hi += '<div class='hi'>';
        hi += '<h2><code>< ~' + window.urb.ship + ': hi. :)</code></h2>'
        hi += '</div>';
        return document.getElementById('loadHi').innerHTML = hi;

      };

    </script>

  </body>
</html>
```

`/=home=/` in that `<script src>` tag just means, "your most current home
directory", since everything is version-controlled through %clay.

By appending the `/~/at/` before the file path in that tag, we told our ship to
inject authentication and user data to the top of our urb.js file under the
`window.urb` object. You can inspect the top of the source file in dev tools:

> screenshot of highlighted injected data

Let's pretty-print that:


```
var _urb = {
  "oryx": "bardys-ridmes-salser-napreg--watwer-ribmyn-midsul-digber",
  "user": "darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn",
  "sein": "zod",
  "ixor": "morret-taspeg-ritlug-fortug",
  "ship": "darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn",
  "auth": [
    "darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn"
  ]
};
```

Urbit code on both the backend and frontend has trended towards four-letter
"lapidary" style. Thankfully, much of the naming conventions on the frontend
side are getting overhauled in the direction of `understandableCamelCase` in
our upcoming [`%eyre` and `:tree` improvements](urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.1.5..01.33.40..2a0e~/). But for now, we're stuck with the question, "What the hell is an `oryx`?" Luckily, these aren't too hard to explain.

An `oryx` is just a [CSRF token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) for
authentication. `ixor` is a hash of this CSRF token, also for
authentication. `user`, `ship` and `auth` are all additionally there for
authentication; if one of the three doesn't match, your ship will know
something isn't right. And lastly, `sein` is the parent of the current ship; all comets have galaxy parents, and in this case, our parent is `~zod`. This is needed so your ship knows where to get its packets, or *cards* from.

If you look in the actual JavaScript of your HTML body's `<script>`, we wrote a
`'hi'` `<div>` to display the value of `window.urb.ship`, which, as per the
injected data above, in this case is your comet ship name, plus some extra text
to mimic the 'hi' message you got in your Dojo. Then we just set our `onClick`
button event to call our `sayHi` function which, upon clicking the button,
swapped the empty `loadHi` `<div>` with the above 'hi' div that displays your
hi message.

urb.js has several wrapper functions over different
[XMLHttpRequests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest) that can send
different requests to your ship's web server, `%eyre`. For this simple example,
we called the `urb.send` function, which takes as arguments a data value, an
object of parameters further specifying the message being sent, and a callback
function to execute upon a successful or failed request. The function then
takes the data value and message parameters and inputs them as arguments to
`JSON.stringify`, the product of which is sent as a JSON payload to your ship's
backend. You ship was then able to parse this JSON and send the right contents
to the right Hoon program for execution.

Let's open up our Network tool in our browser dev tools to look at what JSON
payload `urb.send` delivered:

> screenshot of payload

Pretty-printed:

```
{
  "oryx": "modtuc-diffus-ropdef-novluc--satlev-tomrut-lodres-digweg",
  "xyro": "hi. :)",
  "ship": "darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn",
  "appl": "hood",
  "mark": "helm-hi",
  "wire": "/"
}
```

We're already familiar with what our `oryx` is: an authenticated CSRF token.
Our data value, named `xyro`, was just the string 'hi. :)'. The default `ship`
value is the same one in the `window.urb` object described above. The `params`
we specified we placed in an object that contained two name-value pairs: our
`appl`, for 'application', was `hood`, your ship's system daemon, and our
`mark`, or message type, was a `helm-hi`, which just told `hood` to run our
simple *helm-hi* Hoon program to take the data value sent and print it to the
screen, like a traditional 'Hello, world!'. And the `wire` value we didn't use
this time and thus just defaulted to its fallback value, but in other kinds of
requests, as we'll see in a later section, adding a wire path can allow us to
do some pretty cool things.

Lastly, upon the successful request, our callback function simply
console.logged the request response; our ship sent us an `{ok:true}`, meaning
"everything is all good!". And it console.logged a string we hard-coded,
telling us we just said hi to our ship.

Another example will help make more sense of this. Let's try sending ourselves
a `:Talk` message.

### 1.3 - Let's send some messages using Talk

`:Talk` is our most full-fledged app on Urbit right now, with a backend standing at about 2400 lines of Hoon code. Our primary use case for Talk right now is a sort of distributed, encrypted Slack that can be used from the CLI and the browser.

But really, the Talk protocol is a general-purpose piece of infrastructure for messaging and notifications that Talk-the-app just happens to use. Meaning, we can actually use the Talk protocol as a basic message bus to power any kind of
app.

Before we checkout to the next branch, let's send ourselves a quick message from the Talk CLI, and then take a minute to officially `Log In` to our ship through `:Tree`, Urbit's main general web UI. This will give us full authentication privileges so our messages later in this section can be sent smoothly. And we can also take a peek at Talk the web app to better understand the Talk protocol it's built on top of.

First, sending from the CLI: right now, you should still be in your Dojo prompt in your ship's running terminal window. We've built in a keyboard command to quickly switch between `:dojo` and `:talk` prompts: just `Ctrl-x`.

With your ship's terminal window focused, press `Ctrl-x` on your keyboard, which should bring you into the Talk command-line interface:

```
~darlen_dolmyn:talk[]
```

The `[]` indicates we have ourselves as our message audience. Try sending yourself a message!

> gif of sending self message from the CLI.

Pretty straightforward, right?

Now let's do the same thing, but this time from your Talk web UI. To do this, as said above, we first need to `Log In` to fully authenticate your ship through Tree.

In your browser again, head to your home page being served at `https://localhost:8443`:

> screenshot of home page

and `Log In` at the top right.

We store your web password in your ship itself. You can retrieve it with the `+code` Dojo command.

Press `Ctrl-x` again to switch back into the Dojo, and enter the command:

```
> +code
```

which will give you a four-word password, something like:


```
rapfex-borsef-hacnes-tognet
>

```

Paste that into the password field of the Log In page:

> screenshot of password field filled

and hit Enter, which should bring you back to your home page logged in with the ability to access Talk.

> screenshot of home page with now-showing panel.

Cool. So let's check out Talk the web app.

Click the `Talk` link in the top left, or just enter the URL yourself : `localhost:8443/talk`. You'll load up the Talk web UI:

> screenshot of Talk web UI.

Let's delve into what we're looking at.

The Talk protocol is organized around *posts* and *stations*.

A post is any type of message. It could be a a direct private message from a friend, you broadcasting a public message like a Tweet, or you receiving a news update through an API connector you've plugged into one of your station feeds.

A station is a feed of posts. Any ship can host or subscribe to any number of stations. Additionally, a station itself can be subscribed to other stations, which groups several feeds together in one place. One might want to do this to keep their "dev" station feed separate from their "social" and "music" station feeds

There are four kinds of stations: a publicly write-only %mailbox for only you to see, an invite-only %party for private group conversation, a publicly read-only %journal for curated content, and a public-access %channel for general use.

Every ship boots with a default main, private %mailbox station for direct messages and a personal first feed. This is called the 'court' station for galaxies, the 'floor' station for stars, and the 'porch' station for planets, moons and comets.

When a ship on Urbit subscribes to another Talk station, the default action right now is to subscribe that station to the ship's personal %mailbox station. Which, for most of us on either planets or comets, is our *porch*.

We'll go into these details more in a later section. But let's just try playing around with this in our current Talk web UI, and then see if we can replicate this functionality ourselves with the frontend tools already in your ship.

Since we're on comets, we can use this web UI to send ourselves a direct Talk message at our porch. A valid Talk *audience*, or the station we want to send our posts to, is just the string `~ship/station`.

In the web UI, the audience text box is just above the message text box. Let's send to our porch -- in my case, the audience `~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/porch` -- the message, *'test from the talk web ui!'*

> zoom in screenshot on audience and text box

Hit your Enter key to send.

> GIF of typing, sending and receiving message in web UI and Dojo.

Encrypted, authenticated, typed, exactly-once-delivered messaging by default on Urbit through the Talk protocol. And since this message was sent to your porch, a publicly write-only, only personally readable station, and since this Talk app doesn't rely on any central server other than your personal server to run, only you in fact are able to access, decrypt and read these particular messages.

> Note that, for now, we only allow Talk posts to be lowercase ASCII. For our
> `/urbit-meta` commons channel, this keeps things peaceful. But we're looking
> into ways for ships to be able to configure this on a per-channel basis.

Let's see if we if we can code our own simple way to send ourselves a private porch message by modifying our 'sayHi' code from the last section.

We know from the previous section that regular in-HTML `<script>` JavaScript works for trivial functions. For more complex functionality, of course, we'll want to separate our frontend code into its own directory and simply source the compiled ES5 from our HTML `<head>` like we did with urb.js.

For now, we'll stick with vanilla ES5 (we'll use React in Part 2 of this series). We've organized the `1.3` branch for you with a `tutorial` directory and new `main.js` inside, and your `tutorial.html` updated.

Let's `checkout` to it, then, and copy the code again into our ship's web directory:

```
$ git checkout 1.3
$ cp tutorial.html ~/mycomet/home/web && cp -r tutorial ~/mycomet/home/web
```

You should now have a `tutorial` directory in web, with a `main.js` file inside:

```
$ ls mycomet/home/web/tutorial
main.js
```

with Dojo recognizing the changed tutorial.html file and the added directory and main.js file:

```
: /~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/home/5/web/tutorial/html
+ /~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/home/5/web/tutorial/main/js
>
```

Let's load the page:

> 'Send yourself a Talk message, ~ship!' + textbox and submit

Go ahead, send yourself a message!

> GIF of sending message.

Let's look at the JSON payload we sent by checking our Network dev tool again:

```
{
  "oryx": "falwep-docder-marmev-norpur--sabsem-botlex-hodnup-dirsup",
  "xyro": {
    "publish": [
      {
        "serial": "0v7.985re.6urnn.8g80s.7mn5o.2njuo.0e4mk",
        "audience": {
          "~darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn/porch": {
            "envelope": {
              "visible": true,
              "sender": null
            },
            "delivery": "pending"
          }
        },
        "statement": {
          "bouquet": [],
          "speech": {
            "lin": {
              "txt": "test from our own code!",
              "say": true
            }
          },
          "date": 1489430871493
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "ship": "darlen-natleb-modwer-falrud--bisrev-haltyd-ralwex-dolmyn",
  "appl": "talk",
  "mark": "talk-command",
  "wire": "/"
}
```

It actually looks basically identical to the 'hi' payload from the last section, except for thisway different data payload. Which makes sense, after all. We're just sending a slightly different data payload to a different application, `talk`, using a different mark, `talk-command`, but using the same JSON payload format that `urb.send` and our ship's backend are expecting.

So, let's look under the hood of our code:

Your `tutorial.html` looks like this:

```

```

and here's your `main.js`:

```

```

If you look in the JS... > go into uuid, what Talk is expecting, etc.

In short, we just sent another `urb.send` with a Talk payload to the Talk app.

All of the different urb.js requests are [here](http://urbit.org/docs/using/web/#-urb-js) in our Docs. Let's delve into a few more commands in the next sections though as it relates to using the Talk protocol for our own apps.

### 1.4 - Let's create a new station and send a post to it.

Having a single default station is great for just starting out with Talk. But it can quickly get out of control after subscribing to a number of stations that are highly active.

It'd be great if we could could separate our feeds a bit by having a second station separate from our porch. Let's see if we can do that.

Checkout to branch `1.4` and copy the new code in:

```
$ git checkout 1.4
$ cp tutorial.html ~/mycomet/home/web && cp -r tutorial ~/mycomet/home/web
```

This is the same code from the last section where we send ourselves a Talk message, except this time, instead of sending to our 'porch', we're going to try sending the same message to `a-second-station`.

Reload the page and give it a try:

> gif of trying to send self message, dojo error pops up.

If your Talk command via your JSON payload was valid, you shouldn't have gotten a callback error. But if this command was sent, if you look in your Dojo, instead of printing your Talk post, you should have gotten a slightly cryptic error message:

```
[%ra-know-not ~.a-second-station]
~darlen_dolmyn:talk[]
```

Wat?

All your ship is telling you is, "Someone's trying to connect to a station of mine that I don't know anything about", because the stations doesn't exist. We haven't created the station yet!

So, how do we create a station?

There's a Talk CLI command for creating stations. But it'd be cooler to do this exclusively through the browser.

We can effectively execute the same CLI function by sending a preceding JSON payload with a Talk command that tells our ship to create the new station.

And it'd be great if, instead of manually having to create stations through a button or something, when switching audiences to a station hosted on our own ship, in our JavaScript we just automatically created the station before sending the send-message Talk command in case the station doesn't exist.

So this is what we'll do.

Checkout to branch `1.5`, and copy:

```
$ git checkout 1.5
$ cp tutorial.html ~/mycomet/home/web && cp -r tutorial ~/mycomet/home/web
```

Reload, and try sending to `a-second-station` again!

> gif of no response.

No response at all this time. What's up?

Turns out, you created the station and the post in fact went through. You're just not seeing the post in the second station because, well, it was sent to the second station, not your porch! By design, we wanted this station to be separate from your porch feed that your Dojo is solely subscribed to. And we succeeded!

So, how do I switch stations? Actually, we're still currently working on building that capability into both the Talk CLI and web app (this is still alpha software!). Right now, in our in-house apps, you can't easily organize your app feeds around a station other than your porch, and the stations your porch is subscribed to.

But since we're starting from scratch, we can actually build this functionality ourselves in our own app. All we need to do is send a command to Talk to send us a payload of all the posts of the station we want, and then we can process that payload on the client's side to load our second station's posts onto the page. A super vanilla version of this will only let us see one station at a time, but at least we'll learn a new `urb.js` request!

So let's do that. This will be our last checkout for Part 1.

### 1.5 - Let's finally load our station messages onto the page.

Checkout to branch `1.6` and copy the code in:

```
$ git checkout 1.6
$ cp tutorial.html ~/mycomet/home/web && cp -r tutorial ~/mycomet/home/web
```

Reload the page, and watch the magic happen!
